# Covid Detector
#### By: Gabriel Sereno and Joluan Suave

### Description

This project is focused on detecting the presence of COVID-19 and Pneumonia in a given image.
This is done by using a pretrained model and applying a custom classifier.

### How to setup de project

To run the project, you need to download this image dataset:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eN8rT0cdibnQfCvJ8vsWzNRuqNz7zenM/view?usp=sharing

After downloading the dataset, you must create a folder named "images" and move the images inside, as well as metadata.

Example:
You need to insert the images in this dir: images/COVID and images/Normal, so on.

### How to run the project

Now, you can run the project with whatever notebook python IDE.
The project will run in the notebook and will show the results of the classifier like these examples:

When you choose a image, you can see the results of the classifier in the notebook, 
like percentage of chance to be COVID-19, Pneumonia or Normal.
